## Problem Statement

Physical shopping can often be overwhelming due to the vast array of products available, making it challenging for users to find what they need quickly and efficiently. Additionally, users may face difficulties in comparing products from different brands and making informed purchasing decisions.

## Solution Statement

EasyShop aims to address these challenges by incorporating features such as personalized product recommendations, user reviews, loyalty programs (e.g., discounts & rewards), and side-by-side product comparison. These features enhance the overall shopping experience, promote informed purchasing decisions, and provide valuable insights into customer behavior and trending products through data analytics tools.

## Objective

To develop an E-commerce application prototype that supports a diverse range of products and functionalities while assuring seamless navigation and a responsive user interface.

## Justification

Almost 50% of Kenyan businesses switched to online business during and after the pandemic.
More than 60% of the Kenyan population also switched to shopping online.
According to Google Trends, online shopping in Kenya is estimated to grow by 15% by 2030.
Creating an e-commerce website is projected to be a success and meet future market demands, especially for small-scale and retail offline businesses.
